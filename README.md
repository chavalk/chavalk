# Hello fellow developers

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer. My latest endeavor was learning how to use Amazon DynamoDB, S3, and EC2. JavaScript is the first programming language I learned but I will be learning new languages in the very near future.

You can learn more about me by checking out my online presence via my [portfolio](https://www.josesgarcia.com/), my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-s-garcia/) profile, and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chavalk) account.
